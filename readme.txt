Polarization curves are useful for extracting electrochemical parameters, but they can be challenging to analyze. Secondary cathodic and/or anodic reactions and diffusion control can interfere with the evaluation of electrochemical data, especially at high polarization levels. Moreover, different methods and criteria for estimating the Tafel region can complicate the data extraction process. My preferred method is based on fitting the Wagner-Traud Equation to the polarization data. This method ensures that the fitted region corresponds to the charge transfer control regime, and the extracted parameters are reliable.
I developed a Python code to facilitate the fitting of polarization curves, especially for large datasets. The code takes an excel file (polarization.xlsx) as an input, and outputs the fitted parameters. The excel file should contain the E, i data of different samples in a specific format. I would appreciate your feedback on my code. Please let me know if you find it useful, if you encounter any issues with the extracted electrochemical parameters, or if you have any suggestions for improvement.
I used some hints from Bing AI to develop this code.
